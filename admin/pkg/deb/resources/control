Description: A webmanagement system.
 This program allows users to rapidly build websites and manage them at once.
 It differs from common CMS-solutions, regarding that you are not only able
 to manage one website at a time in your browser, but as many as you want in a
 native GTK-GUI. For further information see the FAQ at http://skarphed.org .
