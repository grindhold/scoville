    The PokeManager manages pokes

    The poke system is a polling system that keeps skarphed clients up to 
    date and informed about changes that happen on the server.

    Pokes are messages that are sent from skarphed-admin to skarphed-core
    and get an answer that contains in which groups of datasets the admin must
    refresh it's data.

    The pokes happen periodically, but the period is increasing if previous pokes
    resulted in more activity, on the other hand decreasing when there is no activity
    on the skarphed-core. There is a maxvalue for the highest pokerate and a minvalue
    for the slowest pokerate.
