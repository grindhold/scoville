Poke system
===========

Definition:

The poke system is a polling system that keeps skarphed clients up to 
date and informed about changes that happen on the server.

Pokes are messages that are sent from skarphed-admin to skarphed-core
and get an answer that contains in which groups of datasets the admin must
refresh it's data.

The pokes happen periodically, but the period is increasing if previous pokes
resulted in more activity, on the other hand decreasing when there is no activity
on the skarphed-core. There is a maxvalue for the highest pokerate and a minvalue
for the slowest pokerate.
