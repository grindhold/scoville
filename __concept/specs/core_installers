Core Installers are folders that contain files which implement the installation and 
deinstallation of skarphed-core on distinct target-systems. A targetsystem consists 
of an operating system and a webserver.

The __init__.py of an coreinstaller must implement the following members:

- TARGETNAME < The name of the InstallationTarget  e.g. "Debian 6 / Apache2"
- EXTRA_PARAMS < extra parameters that are used by the targetsystem (e.g. webserver configvariables)
- Installer < Is an installer that must extend the data.skarphed.Skarphed.AbstractInstaller and
              implement its execute_installation-method.
- Destroyer < Is a class that extends data.skarphed.Skarphed.AbstractDestroyer and implements its
              execute_destruction-method
