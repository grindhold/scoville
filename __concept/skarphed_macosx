Skarphed on Mac OS X:

Steps taken to get it run (tested on Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion)
INFO: do the steps b to e in Terminal.app

a) Install these programms
   - XQuarz   (https://xquartz.macosforge.org)
   - pip      (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
   - macports (https://www.macports.org)
   - brew     (http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew)
     NOTE: install brew under a second user it could convict with macports

b) Install python libs
   - sudo pip install pycrypto
   - sudo pip install paramiko
   - sudo pip install fdb

c) Install GTK (login or SSH to the user where you've installed brew)
   NOTE: I had to do this twice the first time I just got GTK+ without pygtk
   - brew install pygtk
   - brew install pygtk

d) Export $PYTHONPATH and make it permanent -> pythonÂ´s lib locations
   - echo "export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH" >> ~.profile
   - echo "export PYTHONPATH=/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH" >> ~.profile

e) To run Skarphed
   - cd ../admin/src/
   - python skarphed.py

   Gratulations you're done. Skarphed is now running on your Macintosh!

TODO: Add instructions to get python-dev running
