Testing
=======

The plan:

- Install jenkins on a server
- Copy skarphed testing- and helperscripts onto same server

Run:

- A helper script pulls the current code of skarphed from git.
- Delete every possible leftover from former testruns
- Generate .deb-packages of each component, test if packaging went correct
- Install a skarphed-instance on itself using the installer codes of admin/installer
- Install a skarphed-repo on itself using generated package
- Execute tests on core
- Execute tests on repo
- Test gui Datalayer
